Description: Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible illness-
    death models with possibly interval-censored, left-truncated and right-censored
    data. Proportional intensities regression models can be specified to allow for
    covariates effects separately for each transition. We use either a parametric
    approach with Weibull baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with
    M-splines approximation of baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth
    estimates of the hazard functions. Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum
    likelihood in the parametric approach and by penalized maximum likelihood in the
    semi-parametric approach.
